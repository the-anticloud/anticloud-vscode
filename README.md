## The project

This project ("`Code - OSS`") is where we (Microsoft) develop the [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) product together with the community. Not only do we work on code and issues here, but we also publish our [roadmap](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Roadmap), [monthly iteration plans](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Iteration-Plans), and our [endgame plans](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Running-the-Endgame). This source code is available to everyone under the standard [MIT license](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/main/LICENSE.txt).

## Visual Studio Code

<p align="center">

</p>

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is a distribution of the `Code - OSS` project with Microsoft-specific customizations released under a traditional [Microsoft product license](https://code.visualstudio.com/License/).

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) combines the simplicity of a code editor with what developers need for their core edit-build-debug cycle. It provides comprehensive code editing, navigation, and understanding support along with lightweight debugging, a rich extensibility model, and lightweight integration with existing tools.

Visual Studio Code is updated monthly with new features and bug fixes. You can download it for Windows, macOS, and Linux on the [Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download). To get the latest releases every day, install the [Insiders build](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders).

## Related Projects

Many of the core components and extensions to VS Code live in their own projects on GitHub. For example, the [node debug adapter](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-node-debug) and the [mono debug adapter](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-mono-debug) projects are separate from each other. For a complete list, please visit the [Related Projects](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Related-Projects) page on our [wiki](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki).

## Bundled Extensions

VS Code includes a set of built-in extensions located in the [extensions](extensions) folder, including grammars and snippets for many languages. Extensions that provide rich language support (inline suggestions, Go to Definition) for a language have the suffix `language-features`. For example, the `json` extension provides coloring for `JSON` and the `json-language-features` extension provides rich language support for `JSON`.

## Development Container

This project includes a Visual Studio Code Dev Containers / GitHub Codespaces development container.

* For [Dev Containers](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/download/containers), use the **Dev Containers: source project in Container Volume...** command, which creates a Docker volume for better disk I/O on macOS and Windows.
  * If you already have VS Code and Docker installed, you can also click [here](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) to get started. This will cause VS Code to automatically install the Dev Containers extension if needed, source the source code into a container volume, and spin up a dev container for use.

* For Codespaces, install the [GitHub Codespaces](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.codespaces) extension in VS Code, and u

## Contributing

*Excerpt from upstream `CONTRIBUTING.md`:*

# Contributing to VS Code

Welcome, and thank you for your interest in contributing to VS Code!

There are several ways in which you can contribute, beyond writing code. The goal of this document is to provide a high-level overview of how you can get involved.

## Asking Questions

Have a question? Instead of opening an issue, please ask on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/visual-studio-code) using the tag `visual-studio-code`.

The active community will be eager to assist you. Your well-worded question will serve as a resource to others searching for help.

## Providing Feedback

Your comments and feedback are welcome, and the development team is available via a handful of different channels.

See the [Feedback Channels](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Feedback-Channels) wiki page for details on how to share your thoughts.

## Reporting Issues

Have you identified a reproducible problem in VS Code? Do you have a feature request? We want to hear about it! Here's how you can report your issue as effectively as possible.

### Identify Where to Report

The VS Code project is distributed across multiple projects. Try to file the issue against the correct project. Check the list of [Related Projects](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Related-Projects) if you aren't sure which project is correct.

Can you recreate the issue even after [disabling all extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery#_disable-an-extension)? If you find the issue is caused by an extension you have installed, please file an issue on the extension's project directly.

### Look For an Existing Issue

Before you create a new issue, please do a search in [open issues](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues) to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed.

Be sure to scan through the [most popular](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Afeature-request+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc) feature requests.

If you find your issue already exists, make relevant comments and add your [reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments). Use a reaction in place of a "+1" comment:

* 👍 - upvote
* 👎 - downvote

If you cannot find an existing issue that describes your bug or feature, create a new issue using the guidelines below.

### Writing Good Bug Reports and Feature Requests

File a single issue per problem and feature request. Do not enumer

Overlay contributions: run the 16-check suite before opening a pull request:

```sh
python anticloud/bench/runner.py --cwd anticloud
```

## Benchmarks

Measured by the Anticloud assurance suite. Every value below is read from this
project's `BENCH.json`, produced by a real run — the SHA3-256 of that file is
`d4bed5e33b748c6929729e312e19ebac4a45dbdbe483e4959ff25cf03658e23a`.

| Framework | Controls | Evidence | Coverage | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications | 10 controls mapped | 10 with evidence | 100.0% | PASS |
| OWASP Top 10 (2021) | 9 controls mapped | 9 with evidence | 100.0% | PASS |
| SOC 2 Type II readiness | 9 controls mapped | 9 with evidence | 100.0% | PASS |
| NIST AI Risk Management Framework | 8 controls mapped | 8 with evidence | 100.0% | PASS |
| NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 | 12 controls mapped | 12 with evidence | 100.0% | PASS |
| NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0 | 8 controls mapped | 8 with evidence | 100.0% | PASS |
| FedRAMP Rev. 5 | 10 controls mapped | 10 with evidence | 100.0% | PASS |

| MITRE ATT&CK v16 | 12 controls mapped | 12 with evidence | 100.0% | PASS |
| ML Technology Readiness Level | TRL 8 | 8/8 criteria | | PASS |

**Overall: 16/16 checks passing.**

See `ISOLATED_LAB_RESULTS/03_Result_Register.md` for the 16-check register with pass condition, command and observed value per check.

Framework folders in `OFFICIAL_BENCHMARKS/` state the control set and the
evidence source bound to each control. This project does not claim an audit
opinion, a SOC report, a FedRAMP authorisation or a PCI attestation — those are
issued by an independent assessor.
